* Description
This layer replaces =helm-M-x= by [[https://github.com/nonsequitur/smex][amx]] which is built on top of =ido=.
=ido= can perform flex matching with the [[https://github.com/lewang/flx][flx-ido]] mode which is already
activated in the Spacemacs layer.

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =amx= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

* Key bindings

| Key Binding | Description                                |
|-------------+--------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC :~       | all Emacs commands (interactive functions) |
| ~SPC m :~     | current major mode commands                |
| M-x         | all Emacs commands                         |
| M-X         | current major mode commands                |

* Conversion notes
This is a 100% ripoff of the spacemacs smex layer. Changed "smex" to "amx" and added on key binding.
I do not like smex because it is not in active development. amx is in active development.
